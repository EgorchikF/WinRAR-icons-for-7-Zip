This repository was created based on my pure enthusiasm.

I don't like the standard, old-fashioned icons in the 7-Zip archiver.
The Fluent icons by Mr4Mike4 seemed better to me, but still "something's not quite right" :)

I have always liked WinRAR icons, but I don't like the archiver itself.
It's paid and works slower than its free counterpart.
Therefore, I remade WinRAR icons for 7-Zip.

I made many variations. Choose what you like.
Everything is divided into two logical parts: icons for regular archives and separate icons for SFX archives.

Main Icon Sets:

Main - Default Color +formats
Standard colored WinRAR icons, but with format labels (ZIP, RAR, 7z, etc.).
You can immediately see the archive format.

Main - Default Color without formats
Standard colored WinRAR icons as-is. Pure style without changes.
All archives look uniform, just like in WinRAR.

Main - Default Gray Color +formats
Standard gray WinRAR icons, but with format labels.
You can immediately see the archive format.

Main - Default Gray without formats
The same gray icons, but without labels. All archives look uniform, just like in WinRAR.

Main - SFX Style Color +formats
Non-standard icons. The colored icon from the WinRAR SFX archive is used.
Format labels are added. You can immediately see the archive format.

Main - SFX Style Color without formats
Non-standard icons. The same icon from the WinRAR SFX archive is used.
No labels. All archives look uniform.

Main - SFX Style Gray +formats
Non-standard icons. The icon from the WinRAR SFX archive, recolored to gray.
Format labels are added. You can immediately see the archive format.

Main - SFX Style Gray without formats
Non-standard icons. The same icon from the WinRAR SFX archive, recolored to gray.
No labels. All archives look uniform.

Separate Icons for SFX Archives
Since the SFX archive icon in 7-Zip is set separately, I prepared several options — so you can either make everything in the same style or intentionally highlight SFX files.

SFX Icon - Default Gray +format
The standard gray icon from the WinRAR set for regular archive formats, with a format label.

SFX Icon - Default Gray without format
The same standard gray icon unchanged.
No format label.

SFX Icon - Default Color +format
The standard colored icon from the WinRAR set for regular archive formats.
A format label is added.

SFX Icon - Default Color without format
The same standard colored icon from the WinRAR set for regular archive formats.
No format label.

SFX Icon - Original Gray +format
Non-standard icon. The icon from the WinRAR SFX archive, recolored to gray.
A format label is added.

SFX Icon - Original Gray without format
Non-standard icon. The same icon from the WinRAR SFX archive, recolored to gray.
No format label.

SFX Icon - Original Color +format
The standard colored icon from the WinRAR set for SFX archives.
A format label is added.

SFX Icon - Original Color without format
The standard colored icon from the WinRAR set for SFX archives.
No format label.

How to Install Icons:

Download your preferred set of main icons and (optionally) a separate icon for SFX archives.

Copy the corresponding .dll file (x86 or x64 — depending on your 7-Zip version) to the 7-Zip installation folder (usually C:\Program Files\7-Zip or C:\Program Files (x86)\7-Zip for the x86 version).

Confirm file replacement.

Open 7-Zip → Settings → System:

Uncheck the associations (e.g., .zip, .rar, etc.).

Check them again.

Click Apply.

Done! Now your archives look the way you want.

I want to answer a perfectly logical question:
"Will there be a WinRAR-style toolbar?"
My answer: It is not planned at the moment for several reasons:

WinRAR does not have some toolbar item icons that 7-Zip has.

Specifically, I don't like the WinRAR toolbar icons. In this case, personally, I would prefer to use the Fluent toolbar by Mr4Mike4 or other toolbars in the Windows 10/11 style.

I hope I made someone's task easier and helped make the 7-Zip Archiver look the way you want it to.
Wishing everyone kindness and positivity!
